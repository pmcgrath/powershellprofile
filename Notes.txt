Use the following to see all the profile files
	$profile | get-member
We are intrested in the AllUsersAllHosts property which is @ C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\profile.ps1 	

Should place the following into that file so it will dot source all files in our POSHProfile folder

# pmcgrath @ 20/03/2010
# Place this content in the $Profile.AllUsersAllHosts file so all users and all hosts have access to this
#       copy-item Profile_Setup_Readme.txt $Profile.AllUsersAllHosts


# May need to consider the dot sourcing sequence in future in which case we can use a numeric prefix on the script file names
# May also look into using powershell modules


# Dot source all script files in the c:\POSHProfile folder

get-childitem d:\poshprofile *.ps1 | sort name | % { . $_.FullName; }
pop-location;
