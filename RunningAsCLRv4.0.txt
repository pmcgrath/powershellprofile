Powershell.exe is a non managed executable that loads CLR v2.0 by default as of powershell v2.0

To run loading CLR v4.0 we need to create a powershell.exe.config side by side with powershell.exe - can get location using 
	get-process powershell | select path
	
Place the following in the config file
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
	<configuration>
	  <!-- http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w4atty68.aspx -->
	  <startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">
		<supportedRuntime version="v4.0.30319" />
		<supportedRuntime version="v3.5" />
		<supportedRuntime version="v3.0" />
		<supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727" />
	  </startup>
	</configuration>
	
Can test which version of the CLR is loaded using
	[Environment]::Version
will also be able to see new CLR v4.0 functionality using
	[Environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem
	[Environment]::Is64BitProcess
